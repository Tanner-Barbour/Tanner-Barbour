## Biography
---
My name is Tanner Barbour and I am finishing a bachelor's degree in Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise from Virginia Tech. I am interested in the intersection of public health and data science. I am currently working on a bioinformatics pipeline for handling NGS data but enjoy all kinds of data analytics with python and am developing JS skills to build out a portfolio website. I'm looking to expand my career as a healthcare analyst but enjoy building out this page along the way.
